"""
    MutationWeights(;kws...)

This defines how often different mutations occur. These weightings
will be normalized to sum to 1.0 after initialization.
# Arguments
- `mutate_constant::Float64`: How often to mutate a constant.
- `mutate_operator::Float64`: How often to mutate an operator.
- `swap_operands::Float64`: How often to swap the operands of a binary operator.
- `add_node::Float64`: How often to append a node to the tree.
- `insert_node::Float64`: How often to insert a node into the tree.
- `delete_node::Float64`: How often to delete a node from the tree.
- `simplify::Float64`: How often to simplify the tree.
- `randomize::Float64`: How often to create a random tree.
- `do_nothing::Float64`: How often to do nothing.
- `optimize::Float64`: How often to optimize the constants in the tree, as a mutation.
   Note that this is different from `optimizer_probability`, which is
   performed at the end of an iteration for all individuals.
- `form_connection::Float64`: **Only used for `GraphNode`, not regular `Node`**.
   Otherwise, this will automatically be set to 0.0. How often to form a
   connection between two nodes.
- `break_connection::Float64`: **Only used for `GraphNode`, not regular `Node`**.
   Otherwise, this will automatically be set to 0.0. How often to break a
   connection between two nodes.
- `swap_node_pair::Float64`: How often to swap two random nodes.
